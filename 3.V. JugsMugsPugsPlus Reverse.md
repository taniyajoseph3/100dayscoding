# Write a program that receives a number on the input.
It also should receive another value 'rev' (either 1 or 0) on the input. 

  - If the number is a multiple of 3, or it contains digit 3, it prints "Jugs". 
  - If the number is a multiple of 5, or it contains digit 5, it prints "Mugs".
  - If the number is a multiple of 7, or it contains digit 7, it prints "Pugs".

  - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs".
        - also if number contains 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs"
  - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs".
        - also if number contains 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs"
  - If the number is a multiple of 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugPugs".
        - also if number contains 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs"

Otherwise, it prints the number.
```

INPUT 
73 
False  # contains 3 and 7

OUTPUT
JugsPugs
```
```
i = int(input()) 
rev =int(input())
if rev: 
  string = 'Jugs' * bool(i%3==0 or '3' in str(i))
  string = 'Mugs' * bool(i%5==0 or '5' in str(i)) + string 
  string = 'Pugs' * bool(i%7==0 or '7' in str(i)) + string 
  print( string or i) 
else: 
  print("Jugs" * (i%3==0 or '3' in str(i)) + "Mugs" * (i%5==0 or '5' in str(i)) + "Pugs" * (i%7==0 or '7' in str(i)) or i)
